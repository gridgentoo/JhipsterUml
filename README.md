Welcome to JHipster UML!

Please read our [guidelines](/CONTRIBUTING.md#submitting-an-issue) before submitting an issue. If your issue is a bug, please use the bug template pre-populated [here](https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-uml/issues/new). For feature requests and queries you can use [this template][feature-template].

This project's main goal is to bring support of UML (more precisely, XMI) files (from various editors) to JHipster so that it can read the files, without you answering the questions.

You'll be able to create your entities by supplying a UML file (made with your favorite editor, if it supports XMI) to JHipster, and we'll take care of creating your entities for you!

We support: Modelio, UML Designer and GenMyModel.
Moreover, we can convert your XMI file to a JDL one, so that you can use it with [JDL Studio](https://github.com/jhipster/jdl-studio)!

Sparx EA UML models can also be converted to JDL thanks to the awesome work available [here](https://github.com/guillaumefinance/MDG-Sparx-EA-UML-JHipster) made by Guillaume Finance.
